# Advanced HTML

## Learning Objectives

1. Guidelines for HTML:
   - HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
   - Follow the latest HTML specifications and standards, such as HTML5, to ensure compatibility and consistency across different web browsers.

2. Creating the skeleton of an HTML5 page:
   - An HTML5 page starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.
   - The `<head>` section typically contains metadata, like the page title, character encoding, and links to external resources.

3. Using semantic HTML tags to structure a web page:
   - Semantic HTML tags provide meaning to the structure of a web page.
   - Examples of semantic tags include `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<section`, and `<aside>`. Using these tags helps search engines and assistive technologies better understand the content and improves overall accessibility.

4. Use cases for `div` vs. `span`:
   - `<div>` is a block-level element used to group content and apply CSS styles. It's typically used for larger sections.
   - `<span>` is an inline element used to apply styles or mark a part of text within a larger block. It's used for smaller, inline-level content.

5. Semantic value of header, main, footer, article, nav, section, aside:
   - `<header>` represents the introductory content or a container for a page's title or navigation.
   - `<main>` indicates the primary content of a web page.
   - `<footer>` typically contains the footer information or credits.
   - `<article>` is used for self-contained content, like blog posts or news articles.
   - `<nav>` represents navigation links.
   - `<section>` groups related content within a page.
   - `<aside>` represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it.

6. Using headings and their hierarchical order:
   - Headings, such as `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc., are used to structure and provide hierarchy to content.
   - Following the hierarchical order is essential for SEO and accessibility, as it helps in understanding the content's structure and importance.

7. Making lists in HTML:
   - You can create ordered lists with `<ol>` and list items with `<li>`.
   - Unordered lists are created with `<ul>` and list items with `<li>` as well.
   - Description lists are created with `<dl>`, `<dt>` for terms, and `<dd>` for definitions.

8. Differences between image formats (SVG, GIF, PNG, JPG):
   - SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector format suitable for logos and graphics. It's resolution-independent.
   - GIF is used for animations and simple images with transparency.
   - PNG is a lossless format with support for transparency, suitable for web graphics.
   - JPG (or JPEG) is a lossy format ideal for photographs, as it offers good compression but sacrifices some quality.

9. Structuring data in a table:
   - Use the `<table>`, `<tr>` for rows, `<th>` for headers, and `<td>` for data cells.
   - Tables should be used for tabular data, not for layout purposes.

10. Integrating a video and audio in a webpage:
    - You can embed videos and audio using the `<video>` and `<audio>` elements, specifying the source with the `src` attribute.
    - Use appropriate attributes for controlling playback, like `controls` for media controls.

11. Embedding external content:
    - You can embed external content, like videos or maps, using `<iframe>` elements and providing the source URL.

12. Correctly structuring an HTML page:
    - A well-structured HTML page follows a logical order with appropriate headings, semantic tags, lists, tables, and media elements. It should be validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service to ensure compliance with HTML standards.
